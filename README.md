# DiscordVoiceRecorderBot (It's not finished yet...)


***Groundbreaking recording bot! (Not if it already exists.)***

# It would be nice if you could record each person separately using Discord.  
This is a great BOT that solves that problem. (It's not finished yet...).　

Even if more than one person speaks, the files are separate, so editing is easy. Yay!　(/・ω・)/

It's in wav format, so it'll load in almost any editing software! Amazing! :)
